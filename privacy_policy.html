<br>
<br>
Unity Technologies and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “Unity”) offer a 
variety of products, services, and websites for game Developers and game players that 
will be referred to in this policy as the “Service” or “Services.” Because we would 
like to avoid excessive formality and make this information easy to understand, the 
policy refers to Unity as “we” or “us” and to the reader as “you.” When we say “device,” 
we mean any device, including desktop, laptop, PC or Mac computers, smartphones, tablets,
or any other device that is used to access or interact with the Service. When we say “Developer,” 
we mean a third party that develops and/or distributes a game or other app made with Unity 
software and/or a game using Unity Services. By using the Service, you agree to this Privacy 
Policy and understand that we may transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).

* When Users provide payment (e.g. credit card information, billing address, etc.) information to make a purchase, that information is sent to payment processors who assist Unity. Unity’s payment systems are not designed to store credit card numbers.
<br>
* When Users, such as publishers in the Asset Store, provide us with the information we need to send them payments.

<br>
* Users may provide us with information when they participate in community and forum pages on the Services or websites.
<br>
* For certain Developer Services such as Unity Cloud Build, Unity Collaborate, Unity Multiplayer or Unity Analytics, Developers may provide game information and credentials, including source control information as well as codes and keys.
<br>
* Location information:

electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute
security.

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you 
will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me.
Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have 
no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or 
practices of any third-party sites or services.

6. Children’s Privacy

<br>
<br>
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 16. I do not knowingly collect 
personally identifiable information from children under 16. In the case I discover that 
a child under 16 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete those 
informations. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has
